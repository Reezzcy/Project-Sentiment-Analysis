# Tokopedia Product Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on product reviews from the e-commerce platform Tokopedia. The goal is to classify customer reviews into three sentiment categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. To achieve this, we utilize a variety of machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The performance of each model is compared to determine which classifier provides the most accurate sentiment predictions for Tokopedia product reviews. The findings indicate the strengths and weaknesses of traditional machine learning algorithms compared to deep learning approaches like RNN.

## Objective

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning and deep learning techniques for sentiment analysis on e-commerce product reviews. The insights gained can help improve customer experience and assist businesses in understanding customer feedback more effectively.
